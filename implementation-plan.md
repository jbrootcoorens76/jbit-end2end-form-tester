# Elementor Forms E2E Testing - Agent Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
This plan outlines the systematic implementation of an automated testing framework for multiple Elementor forms across WordPress sites using three specialized AI agents. The agents work autonomously and in coordination to deliver a scalable, maintainable test suite with CI/CD integration. All work is performed by agents with human oversight for approvals and direction.

---

## Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements Gathering
**Duration: 1-2 hours | Lead: wordpress-elementor-specialist**
*Agent executes autonomously with provided form URLs*

### Objectives
- Automatically catalog all forms requiring testing
- Document form behaviors and validations through web scraping
- Identify integration points and dependencies
- Generate comprehensive test scenarios

### Agent Tasks
1. **Automated Form Discovery**
   - Agent navigates to provided form URLs
   - Extracts form structure, field types, and attributes
   - Identifies validation patterns through DOM analysis
   - Maps form submission endpoints and methods
   - Documents conditional logic through JavaScript analysis

2. **Intelligent Test Scenario Generation**
   - Analyzes form configurations to generate test cases
   - Creates positive, negative, and edge case scenarios
   - Prioritizes scenarios based on form complexity and field types
   - Generates test data sets automatically

3. **Integration Point Detection**
   - Scans for third-party service integrations (analytics, webhooks)
   - Identifies reCAPTCHA, honeypot, and anti-spam measures
   - Documents email providers and notification systems

### Agent Deliverables
- `forms-inventory.json` - Auto-generated form catalog with configurations
- `test-scenarios.md` - AI-generated comprehensive test cases
- `selectors-map.json` - Stable element selectors for all forms
- `test-data.json` - Generated test data sets for all scenarios

### Human Approval Points
- **Review generated form inventory** (5 minutes)
- **Approve test scenarios** (10 minutes)
- **Validate form URLs and access permissions** (5 minutes)

### Success Criteria
- Agent successfully accesses and analyzes all provided form URLs
- Comprehensive test scenarios generated without human input
- All form variations and edge cases identified automatically

      fullPage: true
    });
  }

  async handleCookieConsent() {
    const cookieButton = this.page.locator('[id*="cookie-accept"]').first();
    if (await cookieButton.isVisible({ timeout: 3000 })) {
      await cookieButton.click();
    }
  }
}
```

**FormHelper.js**
```javascript
export class FormHelper {
  constructor(page) {
    this.page = page;
  }

  async fillField(selector, value) {
    const field = this.page.locator(selector);
    await field.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded();
    await field.click();
    await field.fill(value);
  }

  async selectOption(selector, value) {
    await this.page.selectOption(selector, value);
  }

  async checkBox(selector, check = true) {
    const checkbox = this.page.locator(selector);
    if (check) {
      await checkbox.check();
    } else {
      await checkbox.uncheck();
    }
  }

  async submitForm(buttonSelector = 'button[type="submit"]') {
    await this.page.locator(buttonSelector).click();
  }

  async waitForSuccess(selector = '.elementor-message-success') {
    await this.page.waitForSelector(selector, { timeout: 10000 });
