# Elementor Forms E2E Testing

A simplified functional testing project for Elementor forms using AI agents and Playwright.

## Quick Start

1. **Discovery**: Use `wordpress-elementor-specialist` agent to analyze your forms
2. **Implementation**: Use `playwright-form-tester` agent to generate tests
3. **CI/CD**: Use `devops-test-infrastructure` agent to set up automation

## Project Focus

✅ **What This Does**
- Tests if forms accept valid input and submit successfully
- Tests if forms show validation errors for invalid input
- Runs tests daily and alerts you when forms break
- Simple pass/fail reporting

❌ **What This Doesn't Do**
- Performance testing
- Cross-browser testing
- Advanced monitoring
- Complex dashboards

## Agent-First Approach

**Always use agents first** for any task:
- `wordpress-elementor-specialist` - Form analysis and test scenarios
- `playwright-form-tester` - Test code generation and execution
- `devops-test-infrastructure` - CI/CD setup and basic alerting

## Implementation Plan

Follow `simplified-implementation-plan.md`:
- Phase 1: Form discovery (30 min)
- Phase 2: Test implementation (45 min)
- Phase 3: CI/CD setup (30 min)

**Total**: ~2-3 hours agent work, 30 minutes human oversight

## Documentation

- `CLAUDE.md` - Guidance for Claude Code instances
- `simplified-implementation-plan.md` - Primary implementation approach
- `agent-roles.md` - Detailed agent specifications
- `lessons-learned.md` - Issues and solutions log

## Getting Started

1. Provide your form URLs to the `wordpress-elementor-specialist` agent
2. Let the agents execute the 3-phase implementation plan
3. Review and approve at each checkpoint
4. Your forms will be tested automatically daily
