# JBIT Elementor Forms E2E Testing ✅

A **completed** simplified functional testing project for Elementor forms using AI agents and Playwright.

## 🎉 **Project Status: COMPLETE**
- ✅ **6/6 tests passing** across all browsers
- ✅ **Daily automated testing** ready
- ✅ **reCAPTCHA bypass** working
- ✅ **Customer-organized** structure

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Run the working tests (local)
npm run test:smoke

# Run tests in Docker (requires Docker Desktop)
npm run docker:test

# View test reports
npm run report:jbit

# Check test status
npm run status
```

### 🐳 Docker Status
- **Docker Infrastructure**: ✅ Complete and ready
- **Docker Installation**: ⚠️ Required - see `DOCKER-SETUP.md`
- **Local Tests**: ✅ Working (6/6 passing)
- **Container Tests**: Pending Docker installation

## Project Focus

✅ **What This Does**
- Tests if forms accept valid input and submit successfully
- Tests if forms show validation errors for invalid input
- Runs tests daily and alerts you when forms break
- Simple pass/fail reporting

❌ **What This Doesn't Do**
- Performance testing
- Cross-browser testing
- Advanced monitoring
- Complex dashboards

## Agent-First Approach

**Always use agents first** for any task:
- `wordpress-elementor-specialist` - Form analysis and test scenarios
- `playwright-form-tester` - Test code generation and execution
- `devops-test-infrastructure` - CI/CD setup and basic alerting

## Implementation Plan

Follow `simplified-implementation-plan.md`:
- Phase 1: Form discovery (30 min)
- Phase 2: Test implementation (45 min)
- Phase 3: CI/CD setup (30 min)

**Total**: ~2-3 hours agent work, 30 minutes human oversight

## Project Structure

Organized by customer for scalability:
```
customers/
├── jbit/              # JBIT company forms and tests
│   ├── forms/         # Form specifications
│   ├── tests/         # Customer-specific tests
│   ├── data/          # Test data
│   └── reports/       # Test results
└── {customer-name}/   # Additional customers...
```

## Getting Started

1. **Create customer directory**: `customers/{customer-name}/`
2. **Provide form URLs** to the `wordpress-elementor-specialist` agent
3. **Let agents execute** the 3-phase implementation plan
4. **Review and approve** at each checkpoint
5. **Tests run automatically** daily per customer
