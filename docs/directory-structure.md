# Project Directory Structure

## Overview
The project is organized by customer to support multiple clients with different forms and requirements.

## Root Structure
```
/
├── customers/              # Customer-specific tests and data
│   └── {customer-name}/    # Individual customer directories
├── tests/                  # Shared test utilities and configurations
│   ├── shared/            # Reusable test components
│   └── utils/             # Test helper functions and utilities
├── config/                 # Global configurations
├── docs/                   # Project documentation
├── .claude/               # Agent configurations
└── reports/               # Global test reports and dashboards
```

## Customer Directory Structure
Each customer gets their own isolated directory:

```
customers/{customer-name}/
├── forms/                 # Form specifications and test cases
│   ├── forms-list.json   # Generated by wordpress-elementor-specialist
│   └── test-cases.md     # Generated test scenarios
├── tests/                # Customer-specific Playwright tests
│   └── *.spec.js        # Generated by playwright-form-tester
├── data/                 # Customer test data
│   ├── test-data.json   # Generated test data sets
│   └── *.env           # Customer-specific environment variables
├── reports/              # Customer test execution reports
│   ├── screenshots/     # Failed test screenshots
│   ├── videos/          # Test execution recordings
│   └── *.html          # Test reports
└── README.md            # Customer-specific documentation
```

## Current Customers
- **jbit** - JBIT company (jbit.be)
  - Contact form NL (Dutch)
  - Forms: contact-nl

## Adding New Customers

### 1. Create Customer Directory
```bash
mkdir -p customers/{customer-name}/{forms,tests,data,reports}
```

### 2. Use Agent Workflow
1. **Phase 1**: `wordpress-elementor-specialist` → analyze forms
2. **Phase 2**: `playwright-form-tester` → generate tests
3. **Phase 3**: `devops-test-infrastructure` → setup CI/CD

### 3. Update CI/CD
Customer tests are automatically included in CI/CD pipeline based on directory structure.

## Benefits of Customer Structure
- **Isolation**: Each customer's tests are independent
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new customers without affecting existing tests
- **Customization**: Customer-specific configurations and test data
- **Reporting**: Separate reports per customer
- **Maintenance**: Clear ownership and organization
- **Security**: Customer data separation
