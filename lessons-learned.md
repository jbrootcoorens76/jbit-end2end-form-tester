## Issues Encountered

### Issue: Form Selectors Not Matching Actual Form
**Date**: 2024-09-24
**Agent Involved**: wordpress-elementor-specialist
**Severity**: High

**Problem Description**:
Tests are failing with timeout errors because `input[name='naam']` selector is not found on the JBIT contact form. The generated selectors from Phase 1 don't match the actual form structure.

**Root Cause**:
The wordpress-elementor-specialist agent made assumptions about form field names without actually inspecting the live form HTML structure.

**Solution**:
Need to use playwright-form-tester agent to inspect the actual form and update selectors to match the real form structure.

**Prevention**:
Agent should use actual DOM inspection rather than assumptions about Elementor form patterns.

**Agent Instructions Updated**: Need to update wordpress-elementor-specialist to inspect actual form HTML.

### Issue: Test Results Not Organized by Customer
**Date**: 2024-09-24
**Agent Involved**: playwright-form-tester
**Severity**: Medium

**Problem Description**:
Test results were going to root `test-results/` directory instead of customer-specific `customers/jbit/reports/` directory, making it hard to organize results by customer.

**Root Cause**:
Default Playwright configuration puts all results in a global directory, not considering customer-based project structure.

**Solution**:
Updated `playwright.config.js` with customer-aware output directory configuration and environment variable support.

**Prevention**:
Always configure output directories to match project structure when using customer-based organization.

**Agent Instructions Updated**: Yes - playwright-form-tester now configures customer-specific output directories by default.

### Issue: reCAPTCHA Blocking Test Form Submissions
**Date**: 2024-09-24
**Agent Involved**: playwright-form-tester
**Severity**: High

**Problem Description**:
Tests were failing because JBIT contact form has Google reCAPTCHA protection that blocks automated form submissions.

**Root Cause**:
Production forms often have anti-bot protection that wasn't identified in initial form analysis.

**Solution**:
Implemented comprehensive reCAPTCHA bypass system with 5 different strategies:
1. Network interception and API mocking
2. Script injection with fake grecaptcha object
3. Script blocking to prevent reCAPTCHA loading
4. Environment detection and test parameters
5. DOM manipulation to remove CAPTCHA elements

**Prevention**:
Always check for and document anti-bot protection during form analysis phase.

**Agent Instructions Updated**: Yes - updated to automatically detect and handle reCAPTCHA protection.

### Issue: Cloudflare Turnstile Bypassed Tests (User Agent + IP Whitelisting)
**Date**: 2025-09-25
**Agent Involved**: playwright-form-tester
**Severity**: Critical

**Problem Description**:
After implementing reCAPTCHA bypass, discovered that JBIT site uses Cloudflare Turnstile (not Google reCAPTCHA). Tests were still failing with "Please verify that you are human" and "Your submission failed because of an error" messages despite multiple bypass attempts.

**Root Cause**:
1. Initial assumption was Google reCAPTCHA, but site actually uses Cloudflare Turnstile
2. User agent whitelisting alone was insufficient
3. Local development IP addresses also needed to be whitelisted in both Cloudflare WAF and WordPress Turnstile plugin

**Solution**:
Implemented comprehensive Cloudflare Turnstile configuration:
1. **User Agent Whitelisting**: `JBIT-Bot/1.0 (+https://jbit.be/bot)` in Cloudflare WAF rules
2. **IP Address Whitelisting**: Added local development IPs to both Cloudflare WAF rules AND WordPress Turnstile plugin settings
3. **Enhanced Bypass Scripts**: Updated bypass handler with Turnstile-specific patterns and mocking
4. **Test Validation Logic**: Improved success detection to recognize successful form redirects

**Prevention**:
1. Always identify the specific CAPTCHA system during form analysis (Turnstile vs reCAPTCHA vs hCaptcha)
2. Document that BOTH user agent AND IP whitelisting are typically required for Cloudflare Turnstile
3. Test whitelist configuration changes after deployment (may take 5-30 minutes to propagate)

**Agent Instructions Updated**: Yes - updated playwright-form-tester to handle Turnstile specifically and wordpress-elementor-specialist to identify CAPTCHA type correctly.

### Issue: False Test Results - Successful Form Submission Detected as Failure
**Date**: 2025-09-25
**Agent Involved**: playwright-form-tester
**Severity**: High

**Problem Description**:
After Turnstile whitelist was properly configured, form submissions were succeeding (redirecting to homepage) but tests were failing with timeout errors when trying to check form field values on the redirected page.

**Root Cause**:
Test validation logic was trying to check form fields after successful form submission that redirected to a different page (JBIT homepage). Form fields no longer existed on the success page.

**Solution**:
1. **Smart URL Detection**: Check if still on contact form page before attempting to read form fields
2. **Redirect Recognition**: Recognize URL changes as success indicators
3. **Timeout Handling**: Add shorter timeouts with error handling for field checks
4. **Multiple Success Criteria**: Use URL redirect as primary success indicator alongside form field clearing

**Prevention**:
Always design tests to handle successful form redirects and page changes as success indicators, not failures.

**Agent Instructions Updated**: Yes - updated test validation logic to properly handle successful form submissions with redirects.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Form Selectors Breaking
**Pattern**: Forms change and selectors become invalid
**Solution**: Use more stable selectors (data-testid, ARIA labels)
**Prevention**: Agent should prioritize stable selectors over CSS classes

### Test Environment Access Issues
**Pattern**: Tests fail due to authentication or network issues
**Solution**: Implement proper error handling and retry logic
**Prevention**: Add environment health checks before running tests

### CI/CD Pipeline Failures
**Pattern**: Tests pass locally but fail in CI
**Solution**: Ensure consistent Docker environment
**Prevention**: Always test in containerized environment first

## Project Evolution Log

### Version 1.0 - Initial Implementation
**Date**: [Project start date]
**Scope**: Basic functional testing with simplified approach
**Key Decisions**:
- Focused on functional testing only (no performance/accessibility)
- Daily CI/CD runs with basic alerting
- Agent-first approach for all work

**Lessons Learned**: [To be updated as project progresses]

---

## Best Practices Discovered

### Agent Usage
1. Always start with the most specialized agent for the task
2. Document agent outputs before making manual changes
3. If an agent fails, try a different approach before manual work
4. Update agent instructions based on recurring issues

### Testing Strategy
1. Keep tests simple - focus on "does it work" not "how well does it work"
2. Stable selectors are more important than perfect selectors
3. Clear error messages help with troubleshooting
4. Test in production-like environments (Docker containers)

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. Daily runs are sufficient for functional testing
2. Basic email/Slack alerts are more reliable than complex dashboards
3. Keep reports simple - pass/fail status is what matters
4. Always have a way to run tests locally for debugging

## Emergency Procedures

### When All Tests Fail
1. Check if forms are accessible manually
2. Verify CI/CD environment is working
3. Run tests locally to isolate environment issues
4. Use playwright-form-tester agent to regenerate tests if selectors changed

### When Agents Fail
1. Document the failure in this file
2. Try running the agent with different parameters
3. If agent continues to fail, switch to manual mode temporarily
4. Report agent issues for improvement

### When Alerts Stop Working
1. Verify notification endpoints (email/Slack)
2. Check CI/CD pipeline is running
3. Verify test results are being generated
4. Use devops-test-infrastructure agent to fix alerting
