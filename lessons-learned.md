## Issues Encountered

### Issue: Form Selectors Not Matching Actual Form
**Date**: 2024-09-24
**Agent Involved**: wordpress-elementor-specialist
**Severity**: High

**Problem Description**:
Tests are failing with timeout errors because `input[name='naam']` selector is not found on the JBIT contact form. The generated selectors from Phase 1 don't match the actual form structure.

**Root Cause**:
The wordpress-elementor-specialist agent made assumptions about form field names without actually inspecting the live form HTML structure.

**Solution**:
Need to use playwright-form-tester agent to inspect the actual form and update selectors to match the real form structure.

**Prevention**:
Agent should use actual DOM inspection rather than assumptions about Elementor form patterns.

**Agent Instructions Updated**: Need to update wordpress-elementor-specialist to inspect actual form HTML.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Form Selectors Breaking
**Pattern**: Forms change and selectors become invalid
**Solution**: Use more stable selectors (data-testid, ARIA labels)
**Prevention**: Agent should prioritize stable selectors over CSS classes

### Test Environment Access Issues
**Pattern**: Tests fail due to authentication or network issues
**Solution**: Implement proper error handling and retry logic
**Prevention**: Add environment health checks before running tests

### CI/CD Pipeline Failures
**Pattern**: Tests pass locally but fail in CI
**Solution**: Ensure consistent Docker environment
**Prevention**: Always test in containerized environment first

## Project Evolution Log

### Version 1.0 - Initial Implementation
**Date**: [Project start date]
**Scope**: Basic functional testing with simplified approach
**Key Decisions**:
- Focused on functional testing only (no performance/accessibility)
- Daily CI/CD runs with basic alerting
- Agent-first approach for all work

**Lessons Learned**: [To be updated as project progresses]

## Best Practices Discovered

### Agent Usage
1. Always start with the most specialized agent for the task
2. Document agent outputs before making manual changes
3. If an agent fails, try a different approach before manual work
4. Update agent instructions based on recurring issues

### Testing Strategy
1. Keep tests simple - focus on "does it work" not "how well does it work"
2. Stable selectors are more important than perfect selectors
3. Clear error messages help with troubleshooting
4. Test in production-like environments (Docker containers)

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. Daily runs are sufficient for functional testing
2. Basic email/Slack alerts are more reliable than complex dashboards
3. Keep reports simple - pass/fail status is what matters
4. Always have a way to run tests locally for debugging

## Emergency Procedures

### When All Tests Fail
1. Check if forms are accessible manually
2. Verify CI/CD environment is working
3. Run tests locally to isolate environment issues
4. Use playwright-form-tester agent to regenerate tests if selectors changed

### When Agents Fail
1. Document the failure in this file
2. Try running the agent with different parameters
3. If agent continues to fail, switch to manual mode temporarily
4. Report agent issues for improvement

### When Alerts Stop Working
1. Verify notification endpoints (email/Slack)
2. Check CI/CD pipeline is running
3. Verify test results are being generated
4. Use devops-test-infrastructure agent to fix alerting

## Repository Management

### Commit Guidelines
- Always commit after agent work is completed
- Include agent name in commit message: "[agent-name] Generated test suite"
- Update this lessons-learned.md with any issues encountered
- Tag releases when major functionality is added

### Branch Strategy
- Main branch for production-ready code
- Feature branches for major changes
- Always test in CI before merging

### Issue Tracking
- Use GitHub issues for recurring problems
- Label issues by agent involved
- Close issues when lessons are documented here
